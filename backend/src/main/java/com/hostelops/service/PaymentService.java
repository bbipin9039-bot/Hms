/**
 * Taking payments, and the only code that credits an invoice.
 *
 * <h2>Two guarantees, two different mechanisms</h2>
 *
 * <p>This class is where the project's two hardest concurrency claims live, and they are
 * defended differently because they are different problems.
 *
 * <p><b>A request must not charge twice.</b> That is {@link #initiate}, and the mechanism is
 * {@code uq_fee_payments_idempotency} over the client's {@code Idempotency-Key}. A lookup
 * handles the ordinary retry cheaply; the constraint handles two copies of the same request
 * arriving together, which no lookup can. The window between "check for a duplicate" and
 * "insert one" is exactly the bug being avoided, so the check is not what the guarantee
 * rests on.
 *
 * <p><b>Two payments must not erase each other.</b> That is {@link #settle}, and the
 * mechanism is two row locks: {@code FeePaymentRepository.findByIdForUpdate} on the attempt
 * and {@code HostelFeeRepository.findByIdForUpdate} on the invoice, in that order. Crediting
 * is read-modify-write on {@code amount_paid_paise}: under READ COMMITTED two callbacks
 * landing together both read the old balance and the second write loses the first, so a
 * student who pays twice has one payment vanish from the invoice while its
 * {@code fee_payments} row still says {@code SUCCEEDED}. It is the double-booking race from
 * the allocation code in a different table, and it takes the same fix.
 *
 * <p>The invoice lock alone is not that fix, which is the subtle half. It serialises the two
 * callbacks but does not stop either proceeding, and a <em>part</em> payment leaves the
 * invoice with room to absorb a second credit -- so the second transaction credits again and
 * re-settles the same attempt row on top of the first. Locking the attempt is what makes the
 * status guard true at the moment it is read. {@code docs/concurrency.md} §3 has the trace.
 *
 * <p>Both locks in one transaction means an ordering, and it is attempt-then-invoice
 * everywhere. Nothing else in the codebase takes both, so there is no cycle to deadlock on;
 * a future caller that needs them must take them in this order.
 *
 * <h2>Why a gateway failure rolls the attempt back</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #initiate} claims the idempotency key by flushing the row, and only then opens
 * the order at the provider. If the provider is unreachable, the {@link ApiException} unwinds
 * the transaction and the claimed key goes with it -- so retrying with the same key is a
 * clean first attempt rather than a replay of a broken one. That ordering matters: opening
 * the order first would leave orphaned orders at the provider every time the insert lost a
 * race, and inserting without rolling back would strand the key against a row that has no
 * order to pay.
 *
 * <p>It follows that a committed {@code PENDING} row always carries a
 * {@code provider_order_id}, which is what lets {@link #replay} hand one straight back to a
 * retrying client.
 *
 * <h2>Nothing here believes the caller</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #settle} takes an order reference, a payment reference and a signature. It does
 * not take an amount -- that comes off the {@code fee_payments} row -- and it does not take
 * an outcome. The signature is the entire authorization for moving money, verified by the
 * adapter named on the stored row rather than by the currently-configured provider, so a
 * payment started before a gateway switch is still settleable afterwards.

    /**
     * Settles a payment from a verified provider callback.
     *
     * <p>The order of the five steps is the security argument, and each one is load-bearing.
     *
     * <p>First the attempt is resolved, which is what says who the provider is. Verification
     * uses the adapter named on that row rather than the configured one, so the caller cannot
     * choose which secret their signature is checked against -- a callback that named its
     * own provider would let anyone pick the gateway whose secret they happen to know. Only
     * the id and the provider name are read, as scalars: the entity must not enter the
     * session before the lock, for the reason the third step gives.
     *
     * <p>Second the signature is checked, before anything about the payment's state is
     * revealed or acted on. An unauthentic caller therefore cannot tell a settled payment
     * from an unsettled one, and cannot cause a row lock to be taken at all.
     *
     * <p>Third the attempt row is locked, and this is its first and only read. Gateways
     * redeliver callbacks -- all of them do -- and re-settling would credit the invoice a
     * second time for one payment. The status guard that stops that is only as good as the
     * read behind it, so the read has to be the one holding the lock: an unlocked read
     * followed by a lock would leave the guard looking at a copy taken before the winning
     * transaction committed, because Hibernate keeps the instance already in the session and
     * throws away what the {@code FOR UPDATE} returned. A 409 rather than a silent success
     * because the duplicate is worth surfacing, and {@code PAYMENT_ALREADY_SETTLED} says
     * exactly which case it is.
     *
     * <p>Fourth the invoice is locked, and fifth it is credited. Two locks in one
     * transaction, always attempt before invoice -- see the class Javadoc. They are taken
     * here rather than earlier so they are held for the shortest possible span, and between
     * them they cover the only read-modify-write in the method.
     *
     * <p>Deliberately three parameters rather than the bound request record: the aspect that
     * writes the audit trail redacts by parameter name, and a signature reaching
     * {@code payload_diff} inside an innocuously-named record is precisely the gap
     * {@code AuditAspect} documents. Naming the parameter {@code signature} closes it. A
     * transposed order id and payment id is not a silent failure either -- the signature is
     * computed over the two in a fixed order, so verification fails immediately in every
     * environment, the mock included.
