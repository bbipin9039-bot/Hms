/**
 * The accommodation lifecycle end to end: apply, decide, allocate, and the
 * rollback when the decision cannot be honoured.
 *
 * <p>{@code ApplicationServiceTest} already proves the service calls the
 * allocation path and lets its exception escape. What it cannot prove is the
 * consequence, because a unit test has no transaction: it asserts that
 * {@code approve} threw, not that the approval is absent from the database
 * afterwards. Those are different claims, and only the second one matters. An
 * approval that survives a failed allocation produces a student who has been
 * told they have a room and has no bed -- the worst possible outcome for this
 * feature, and one that looks completely fine from the warden's screen.
 *
 * <p>So the central test here is {@code approvalRollsBackWhenNothingIsAvailable}:
 * a 409 comes back, and the application is still {@code PENDING}, and the
 * student is still {@code PENDING}, and no allocation row exists. Everything
 * else in this class is the happy path that makes that test meaningful.
 *
 * <p>Year 5 is used for the no-room case. The room inventory in
 * {@code V2__room_reference_data.sql} covers years 1 to 4 -- one floor per year
 * -- so a fifth-year student has no eligible room anywhere in the building and
 * the failure is a property of the data rather than of a fixture that some other
 * test could fill up.
