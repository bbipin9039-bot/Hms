/**
 * The proof that a redelivered payment callback credits an invoice once.
 *
 * <p>{@code PaymentService} and {@code MockPaymentGateway} both cite this class by name. Every
 * gateway redelivers callbacks -- on a timeout, on a non-2xx, on an operator's replay from the
 * dashboard -- so "the same callback arrives twice" is the normal case, not the exotic one, and
 * the two things standing against it are a status guard and a row lock. Neither can be proven
 * with a mocked repository: a mock has no READ COMMITTED snapshot and no {@code FOR UPDATE}.
 *
 * <h2>The signature is real here</h2>
 *
 * <p>Callbacks are signed with {@link MockPaymentGateway#signatureFor}, an HMAC over the same two
 * references the adapter verifies, using the same published development secret. So the
 * verification branch under test is the one production takes -- there is no test-only bypass,
 * which is the point of the mock holding a real secret rather than a flag that skips the check.
 *
 * <h2>Why there are two racing fixtures</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #concurrentRedeliveriesCreditTheInvoiceOnce} races a payment for the invoice's whole
 * balance, and on its own it proves less than it appears to. A full-amount redelivery is refused
 * partly by {@code HostelFee.applyPayment} declining to overshoot, so that test passes even if
 * the attempt row is never locked at all -- which is exactly what used to happen, and what
 * {@code docs/concurrency.md} §3 recorded as an open defect for two days.
 *
 * <p>{@link #concurrentRedeliveriesOfAPartPaymentCreditTheInvoiceOnce} is the fixture with no
 * such accidental help. Half an invoice leaves room for a second credit, so nothing in the
 * domain model objects; the only thing standing between one part payment and two credits is the
 * lock {@code PaymentService.settle} takes on the attempt row before it reads the status. Racing
 * the partial case is therefore the test that fails against the old code, and the pair of them
 * together says both that the guarantee holds and where it comes from.
