/**
 * The admin area's guard and frame.
 *
 * <p>Two pages live here, and both are operational rather than day-to-day: the
 * scheduled jobs, which can be run by hand for a chosen date, and the audit log. They
 * are separate from the warden console because `/api/v1/admin/**` is gated on
 * `hasRole("ADMIN")` alone -- a warden cannot reach either endpoint, so putting the
 * links in their nav would be an invitation to a 403.
 *
 * <p>The last section links across to the warden console, because an admin genuinely
 * can use it: see the note in the warden layout. It is a nav entry rather than a
 * duplicated set of pages.
