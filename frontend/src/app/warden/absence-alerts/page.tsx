/**
 * The absence queue.
 *
 * <p>Two lists behind one toggle, because they answer different questions: the open
 * list is a worklist ("who needs a call today"), the full list is a record ("was this
 * ever followed up"). They are separate endpoints on the server for the same reason,
 * and the toggle makes that visible rather than hiding it behind a status filter.
 *
 * <p>Acknowledging is the only write, and it can lose a race: two wardens on the same
 * queue, and the second one gets a 409 `ALERT_ALREADY_ACKNOWLEDGED`. That is handled
 * as information rather than as an error -- the alert *is* acknowledged, which is the
 * outcome the click wanted -- so the list refetches and the row shows who got there
 * first. Only genuinely failed acknowledgements surface as an error.
 *
 * <p>Alerts cannot be created or deleted from anywhere in this app, which mirrors
 * `AbsenceAlertController`: an alert is derived from the register, so the only honest
 * way to make one appear is for the register to say a student is missing, and the only
 * way to make one go away on its merits is for the register to say they came back.
